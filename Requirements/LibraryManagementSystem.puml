' --- Actor Notes ---
note left of Librarian
  **Librarian**: A primary actor who is responsible
  for managing the library's daily operations. The
  Librarian registers new members, maintains and
  updates the book catalog, processes book returns,
  and generates reports on library activities.
end note

note right of Member
  **Member**: A primary actor who represents a
  registered library user. The Member can search
  for books, borrow available books, and return
  borrowed books. If a book is returned late, the
  Member may also be required to pay a fine.
end note

' --- Use Case Notes ---
note top of UC1
  **Manage Catalog**: The Librarian adds, updates,
  or removes book entries in the library catalog to
  keep the collection accurate and up to date.
end note

note top of UC2
  **Register Member**: The Librarian creates a new
  member account by collecting the user's personal
  details and assigning a unique membership ID.
end note

note bottom of UC3
  **Generate Report**: The Librarian requests the
  system to produce reports on borrowing activity,
  overdue books, or overall library statistics.
end note

note top of UC4
  **Search Book**: The Member queries the system
  using keywords, title, or author to find books
  available in the library catalog.
end note

note top of UC5
  **Borrow Book**: The Member selects an available
  book and checks it out. This use case always
  includes Search Book first to locate the book.
end note

note bottom of UC6
  **Return Book**: Both the Member and the Librarian
  can process the return of a previously borrowed
  book. If the book is overdue, Pay Fine is triggered.
end note

note bottom of UC7
  **Pay Fine**: If a borrowed book is returned after
  the due date, the Member is required to pay a
  penalty fine before the return can be completed.
end note
